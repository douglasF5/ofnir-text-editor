      <h2>Advantages of Tailwind CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Tailwind CSS is gaining popularity among developers due to its simplicity and flexibility. With its utility-first approach, you can rapidly build user interfaces by composing small, reusable utility classes. As Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS, describes it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>The utility-first workflow doesn't separate styling from markup. Instead, it embraces it as a way to make the markup more expressive.
      </blockquote>
      <p>This approach allows for faster prototyping, consistent designs, and highly customizable components.</p>
      <p>Let's see an example of how easy it is to create a styled button using Tailwind CSS:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplicity: Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach, allowing you to quickly build user interfaces by composing small, reusable utility classes.</li>
        <li>Flexibility: The extensive set of pre-defined utility classes in Tailwind CSS gives you the flexibility to customize and style your components precisely.</li>
        <li>Rapid Development: With Tailwind CSS, you can expedite development by leveraging ready-to-use utility classes, reducing the need for writing custom CSS from scratch.</li>
        <li>Consistency: Tailwind CSS promotes consistency across your project by enforcing a defined set of utility classes, resulting in a unified and cohesive design.</li>
        <li>Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS offers built-in responsive design classes, making it easier to create adaptive layouts for various screen sizes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Drawbacks of Tailwind CSS</h2>
      <p>
        While Tailwind CSS provides many benefits, it's important to consider a few drawbacks. The learning curve can be steep for developers accustomed to traditional CSS frameworks. The extensive use of utility classes might lead to a larger CSS file, impacting the website's performance if not optimized. Furthermore, since Tailwind CSS encourages inline styles using utility classes, the HTML markup can be less semantic and more focused on styling concerns.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learning Curve: Tailwind CSS introduces a unique syntax and utility classes, which may require some initial learning and adjustment for developers accustomed to traditional CSS approaches.</li>
        <li>Increased File Size: Utilizing a comprehensive set of utility classes can lead to increased file size, which might impact the performance of your website if not optimized properly.</li>
        <li>Less Semantic Markup: The heavy reliance on utility classes in Tailwind CSS can result in HTML markup that is less semantic and more focused on styling, potentially making the code less readable or maintainable.</li>
        <li>Design Limitations: While Tailwind CSS provides a broad range of styling options, it might not suit complex or highly customized design requirements that demand more granular control.</li>
        <li>Override Complexity: Overriding default styles or customizing the framework extensively can sometimes be challenging due to the specificity and interdependencies of the utility classes.</li>
      </ol>
